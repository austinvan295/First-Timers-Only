Introduce Yourself
The simplest way to contribute to this repo.

Just create a file (Your-Name.md or Your-Name.txt) here and write down whatever comes to your mind, introducing yourself. Commit and create a PR. Have fun!

Please note: Any PRs from this folder will be marked invalid during October and will not count towards Hacktoberfest as:

High-quality contributions are part of the the core values of Hacktoberfest, and quickly gaining a PR towards completing the challenge will not be fair.

That said, you may freely use this folder to introduce yourself and learn about Git and GitHub.

Thanks for understanding!
