Introduce Yourself The simplest way to contribute to this repo.

Just create a file (Your-Name.md or Your-Name.txt) here and write down whatever comes to your mind, introducing yourself. Commit and create a PR. Have fun!

That said, you may freely use this folder to introduce yourself and learn about Git and GitHub.

Thanks for understanding!
