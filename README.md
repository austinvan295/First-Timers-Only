## **Things To Work On In This Project**
### Introduction
Contributing to open source projects tends to be a little complex and nerve-wracking at first due to having to know many things such as forking, pull request, issues, how to format questions, and etc. This repository is intended to give newcomers their first open source contribution and to also show how to contribute efficiently.<br>

To start contributing please look at the contributing.md to see what format to use and how you can make your firrst contribution today! Once you start contributing more to this project the more you will learn and in no time you will be contributing to other open source projects like a pro. 
### Requirements
Please make a seperate repository and do **NOT** commit to the master branch directly. Always make sure to do a pull request to keep things organized
 * Troubleshooting
 * FAQ
 * Maintainers
